## About
This is a website created as part of a Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Capstone Project. The team worked with the upcoming Eastern General Hospital in Bedok, Singapore, to prototype a park design for potential incorporation into the green space beside the future campus.

The webpage aims to complement the architectural solution, by offering a digital platform for park users to interact with one another. There is a community feed where users can make and comment on posts, similar to typical social media apps. There is also a built-in eevent calendar to inform users of upcoming events.

View the webpage [here](https://healthybedoknorth.vercel.app/).

## How it's made

The webpage is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), React TypeScript, Tailwind and Neon Postgres.

It is developed with a mobile-first approach, as it is expected that users will be accessing it via their mobile devices. The webpage is still desktop friendly, however.

## Ending note

This project was my first time deploying a fully functional web application from scratch, working with Tailwind and implementing (relational)databases on any level in a production app, and my second time working with React. It has been a fruitful experience and I hope to further my skills and knowledge in this area of software engineering.
